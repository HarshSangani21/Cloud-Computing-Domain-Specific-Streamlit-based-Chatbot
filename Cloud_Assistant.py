# Predefined context
context = """Google Cloud Platform (GCP), offered by Google, is a suite of cloud computing services that provides a series of modular cloud services including computing, data storage, data analytics, and machine learning, alongside a set of management tools. It runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search, Gmail, and Google Docs, according to Verma, et.al. Registration requires a credit card or bank account details.

Google Cloud Platform provides infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and serverless computing environments.

In April 2008, Google announced App Engine, a platform for developing and hosting web applications in Google-managed data centers, which was the first cloud computing service from the company. The service became generally available in November 2011. Since the announcement of App Engine, Google added multiple cloud services to the platform.

Google Cloud Platform is a part of Google Cloud, which includes the Google Cloud Platform public cloud infrastructure, as well as Google Workspace (G Suite), enterprise versions of Android and ChromeOS, and application programming interfaces (APIs) for machine learning and enterprise mapping services.

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) operates on several key principles that guide its design, operation, and service offerings. These principles are fundamental to understanding how Google Cloud provides reliability, scalability, and security to its users:
1. Security First Approach:
Google Cloud Platform prioritizes security across its infrastructure, services, and operations. Key aspects of its security-first approach include:
Built-in Security: Security features such as encryption at rest and in transit, IAM (Identity and Access Management), and network security policies are built into every layer of GCP services.
Compliance and Certifications: GCP adheres to industry standards and certifications (e.g., ISO 27001, SOC 2, PCI DSS) to ensure data protection and regulatory compliance.
Continuous Monitoring and Protection: Google employs advanced threat detection, anomaly detection, and incident response mechanisms to monitor and protect its infrastructure and customer data.

2. Global Infrastructure:
Google Cloud operates on a global network of data centers strategically distributed around the world. Key aspects of its global infrastructure include:
Availability Zones and Regions: GCP divides its infrastructure into regions (geographical locations) and availability zones (physically separate locations within regions) to provide redundancy and fault tolerance.
Edge Locations: Google's extensive network of edge locations and points of presence (PoPs) ensures low-latency access to services and data for users globally.

3. Scalability and Flexibility:
GCP is designed to scale seamlessly to meet the evolving needs of businesses. Key scalability and flexibility principles include:
Elastic Compute Resources: Services like Compute Engine and Kubernetes Engine enable businesses to scale compute resources up or down based on demand without downtime.
Managed Services: GCP offers fully managed services (e.g., Cloud SQL, BigQuery) that automatically scale to handle workload fluctuations and peak demands.
Serverless Computing: Products like Cloud Functions and App Engine allow developers to focus on writing code without worrying about infrastructure management, enabling rapid deployment and scaling.

4. Openness and Hybrid Cloud:
Google Cloud embraces an open approach, supporting a wide range of operating systems, programming languages, frameworks, and tools. Key aspects include:
Multi-Cloud and Hybrid Cloud Solutions: GCP provides solutions for connecting on-premises infrastructure with cloud resources (e.g., Anthos), facilitating hybrid cloud deployments.
Interoperability: GCP services integrate with popular open-source technologies and third-party tools, promoting interoperability and flexibility for developers and IT teams.

5. Innovation and Sustainability:
Google Cloud is committed to continuous innovation and sustainability. Key principles include:
Advanced Technologies: Investment in cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and data analytics to drive innovation and business transformation.
Environmental Responsibility: Google Cloud is committed to sustainability, striving for energy efficiency, reducing carbon footprint, and supporting renewable energy initiatives across its data centers.

6. Reliability and Resilience:
Google Cloud Platform is engineered to deliver high availability, reliability, and resilience. Key principles include:
Redundancy and Failover: Services are designed with redundancy and failover mechanisms across multiple availability zones and regions to minimize service interruptions.
SLAs (Service Level Agreements): GCP provides SLAs for uptime and performance for its core services, ensuring reliability and accountability.
